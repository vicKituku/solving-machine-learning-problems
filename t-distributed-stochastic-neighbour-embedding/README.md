# t-SNE Clustering of MNIST Dataset

This repository contains Python code to demonstrate how to use t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize clusters within the MNIST dataset. t-SNE is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. In this case, we use it to visualize clusters of similar handwritten digits.

- I'm using a sample size of 3000
